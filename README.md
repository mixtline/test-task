Task: to develop dynamic routing for Symfony3 
=====

1. We cannot use Symfony CMF. I found it works for Symfony2 only.

2. Custom routing

3. Catch kernel.request event

4. Account to documentation we can use route configs in php. 
It means we can get current path in our /app/config/routing.php, split it (the same way as we did for 2 and 3)
and get correct route (or exception if the route is wrong).

5. To develop a script that will find all bundles and will generate routing.yml for all found controllers.
 The only negative face - we will need to run the script after deploy or after each adding/removing action in the controllers.
